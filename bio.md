##About Me
Hello, my name is Micheal Willard. This is my fourth term in the CS program here. I am originally from Belgrade, MT where I graduated from Montana State University with a BS in Mechanical Engineering in 2008. My first job out of school was designing galleys and seats for commercial airlines.  After that I moved to Seattle where I am currently working for a well known aircraft manufacturer.

In the summer I play in an adult baseball league and in the winter I spend my weekends skiing the steep and deep. When I had more free time I enjoyed brewing beer, remodeling my house, mountain biking, video games, hacking and modding products and spending too much time and money on LEGO.

Upon graduation, I’m hoping I have the skills and experience to land a job doing something interesting and challenging. I have a wide array of interests, from computer games to robotics, that should allow me to find a position that suits me. In general, the way I see most engineering industries moving is towards a job market that will require some programming experience. My hope is this gets me a leg up to be more competitive. It’s still early in the program for me so I am still entertaining the idea of getting my Masters in CS after this.

##Programming Background
The bulk of my programming experience has been from this program. So I am a little comfortable in C++ now, with a half a year’s experience. I do most of my programming on Xcode on my Mac. I’ve explored into their Objective-C kits a little bit and have also begun to work on learning Java. Prior to enrolling in this class, I had little programming experience in college. We used MathLab and ANSYS (a finite element analysis software that uses ANSYS Parametric Design Language). In high school I had more experience. I was very fluent in HTML, had a little javascript knowledge and took two Cisco Networking courses. 

The most enjoyable project I have worked on in this program so far came back in CS 161.  I Chose to make very basic command line/text based RPG game.
