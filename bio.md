##About Me
Hello, my name is Micheal Willard. This is my fourth term in the CS program here. I am originally from Belgrade, MT where I graduated from Montana State University with a BS in Mechanical Engineering in 2008. After that I moved to Seattle where I am currently working for a well known aircraft manufacturer.

##Programming Background
The bulk of my programming experience has been from this program. So I am a little comfortable in C++ now, with a half a year’s experience. I do most of my programming on Xcode on my Mac. I’ve explored into their Objective-C kits a little bit and have also begun to work on learning Java. Prior to enrolling in this class, I had little programming experience in college. We used MathLab and ANSYS (a finite element analysis software that uses ANSYS Parametric Design Language). In high school I had more experience. I was very fluent in HTML, had a little javascript knowledge and took two Cisco Networking courses.
